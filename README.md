# Crime-Reporting-System
The Online crime reporting system which is a Web application designed in PHP  which aims to provide crime management solutions such as filing of FIR  and checking its status accessible to everyone

We created a website with 4 functionalities which includes login pages for user, police in charge, station in charge and police headquarters

‚Ä¢ User can register and login and a file a complaint using Aadhar card

‚Ä¢ The case was then assigned randomly to a police officer of the nearest police station

‚Ä¢ The police office can update the case from the police login portal and update the status of case such as fir filed, criminal identified, criminal caught etc.

‚Ä¢ From station in charge portal all the cases that have been to assigned to the policer officers of that station can be viewed from this portal we can also add police officers to that police station
